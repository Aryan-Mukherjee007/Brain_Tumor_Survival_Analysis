# Brain_Tumor_Survival_Analysis
Open source code for my second machine learning research paper conducting survival analysis on brain tumors patients using the Cox proportional hazards model and multiple log-rank tests. Please consult this link for the original data file:

All code can also be run in google colab, at this link:

Due to page restrictions, not all results could be included in the paper. Most notably is assumption testing, which was formally completed and written both in theory and code. For my theory, please reach out personally. For the code, and all other tested but omitted results, please consult this link:
